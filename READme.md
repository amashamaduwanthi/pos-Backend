**POS System Backend**

This repository houses the backend API for the Point of Sale (POS) system. The frontend is already complete, and this backend is crafted to integrate effortlessly with it, delivering reliable, scalable, and secure services to manage core business logic and data operations.

**Overview**

The POS System is tailored to efficiently handle customer orders, inventory, and sales. This backend is built using Jakarta EE, emphasizing a well-structured layered architecture, adherence to coding best practices, and ensuring secure database interactions.

**Technology Stack**

- **Jakarta EE**: An enterprise framework for developing robust and scalable applications.
- **MySQL**: A relational database used for persistent data storage.
- **AJAX/Fetch**: Utilized for asynchronous communication between the frontend and backend.
- **JNDI**: Java Naming and Directory Interface for managing database configurations.

**Database Configuration**

Database connectivity is managed via JNDI, with `persistence.xml` or other relevant configuration files set up to ensure secure and efficient access to the MySQL database.

- **Database**: MySQL
- **JNDI Name**: java:/comp/env/jdbc/storeRegistration
- **Schema**: The database schema consists of tables for Customers, Orders, Items, and Order Details.

**API Endpoints**

The backend offers a suite of RESTful APIs to perform operations such as creating orders, updating customer details, and managing inventory. Detailed documentation for these endpoints is available here.

**Sample API Endpoints:**

- **Customer Operations**
    - GET /customer
    - POST /customer
    - PUT /customer/{nic}
    - DELETE /customers/{nic}

- **Item Operations**
    - GET /item
    - POST /item
    - PUT /item/{id}
    - DELETE /item/{id}

- **Order Operations**
    - GET /orders
    - POST /orders

**Logging**

Logging is implemented using Jakarta EE’s built-in logging framework, with different levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR) applied as needed to capture application events, aiding in monitoring and troubleshooting.

**Getting Started**

To set up the project locally:

1. Ensure MySQL is installed and running. Import the database schema provided in the SQL directory.
2. Configure JNDI: Set up the JNDI resource in your Jakarta EE server configuration (e.g., Tomcat).
3. Build and deploy the application using your preferred Jakarta EE compatible server.
4. Run the application by accessing it through the frontend connected to the backend.
